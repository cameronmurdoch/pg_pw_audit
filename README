PostgreSQL extension to record when a database user's password is changed.

Experimental - there will be bugs.

This works, but is definitly alpha quality and currently has only been tested
against PostgreSQL 14 on RHEL8.

Also, let's be clear. If you have a lot of users, or some other complicated
requirements then you should probably be using some other form of password
management.

For example:

1. TLS certificates
2. Kerberos/GSSAPI
3. LDAP - sends password in cleartext, use with TLS if no other choice
4. PAM with whatever plugin make you happy

Certificates and GSSAPI should probably be the preferred choices in most
situations.

However sometimes the above aren't availble or aren't appropriate.
The scram-sha-256 authentication in Postgres >= 10 is really nice, but it is
frustrating to not know when a password was changed and possibly who changed it.

What action you choose to take with this information is up to you. Forcing users
to change their passwords frequently could be a bad idea and can actually lead
to *reduced* security.

However, as mentioned it is still nice to know when a password was last changed.
